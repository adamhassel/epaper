Driver and example program for [tri-color 7.5" 880x528 (HD, lol) Waveshare eink display](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/7.5inch_HD_e-Paper_HAT_(B))

It's a work in progress, which lacks a lot of safeguarding (meaning it'll probably explode if you do something unexpected, like trying to upload a PNG smaller than the expected resolution), and based on the C/Python code published by Waveshare, as well as a bunch of similar projects out there on github and elsewhere.

Use at your own peril, etc.
